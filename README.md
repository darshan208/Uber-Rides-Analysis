# Air bnb Data analysis

This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride data to derive insights into ride patterns, customer behavior, driver performance, and operational efficiency. By using SQL for data extraction and manipulation, and Tableau for creating visual dashboards

## Project Overview
Uber generates a large volume of data related to rides, drivers, and customer behavior. This project aims to:

* Data Analysis: Use SQL to query and analyze key metrics related to rides, customers, and drivers.
* Visualization: Create interactive dashboards using Tableau to visualize trends and performance metrics.

## Key Objectives:
* Extract and clean Uber ride data using SQL.
* Analyze ride patterns, customer preferences, and driver performance.
* Visualize key metrics such as total rides, revenue trends, peak times, and geographical analysis.

## Dataset:
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information such as:
* Ride Details: Trip ID, date, time, pickup and drop-off locations, distance traveled, and fare amount.
* Customer Information: Demographics  and feedback.
* Driver Information: Driver ID, ratings, total trips, and performance metrics.

## Tool used:
* **SQL:** For data extraction, querying, and analysis.
* **Tableau:** For building interactive visual dashboard.

## SQL Techniques:
* Joins: To merge data from multiple tables (rides, customers, and drivers).
* Aggregations: To calculate metrics like total rides, revenue, and average trip distance.
* Filters & Conditions: To isolate specific data segments, such as rides from certain locations or times.
* Group By: To analyze data by categories such as customer type, ride distance, or time period.
